    "Just another software engineer laid off from Initech. I like building cool stuff with cool tools and sacrificing my youth to do so. If you need something groundbreaking built or if you just like to keep a modern-day George Costanza around, I'm your man. You can see what I've done on the [projects](/projects) page, browse my code on [github](http://github.com/rdallman) or check out my [resume](/hire/resume) for more about yours truly."
